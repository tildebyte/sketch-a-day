A straightforward Python script, running on (free) Google App Engine.

Display:
- A sketch prompt every day, chosen at random from a list of 365.
- A media prompt (I need to learn to use something other than a 6B :pencil:).
- A gallery of links to tutorials on sketching/drawing
- Prompts a list of prompts from previous days.
